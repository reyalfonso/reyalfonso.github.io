         <h2>Who am I ?</h2>
         <p>
            Originally born and raised in the province of Bulacan, Philippines 
            and came to Canada nine years ago. It was difficult for the first 
            few years because of the different lifestyle in canada 
            compared to my usual life. but after three years I 
            gradually got used to it. Because I have a family and 
            I need to find a good job to give my two children a good future, 
            I thought of studying and taking a web development and fundamentals course.
         </p>
